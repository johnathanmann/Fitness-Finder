# Fitness-Finder

## Description

Our project's aim is to make it easier for people to find workouts that apply to the areas of the body that they would like to strengthen. In addition to that, we would like to provide an easy way for users to locate gyms near them. It is important to note that this project does not currently determine whether or not these locations have the means to perform the workouts given. Our team has decided that such a feature is not required in our MVP (Minimum Viable Product).

User Story:

As an active person,
I want to find applicable workouts and nearby gyms
So that I can improve my bodyâ€™s wellness

Acceptance Criteria:

Given my location and target muscle
When I search for workouts
Then I am given specific results about applicable workouts and given the option to search for gyms near me
